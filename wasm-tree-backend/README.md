# Wasm Tree Backend

This package provides a web assembly backend for manipulating
trees containing 4 numbers that may be sorted in any order.

The multiple sort order enables to do efficient pattern matching on any
pattern.

This library is used as a backend for the Wasm Tree library, which is a RDF.JS
compliant RDF dataset and store implementation.

The bindings from Rust to Javascript are built using the wasm-pack /
wasm\_bindgen toolkit.
